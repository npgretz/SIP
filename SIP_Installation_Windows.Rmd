## Windows Command Prompt    
This installation will use Windows Command Prompt (`cmd`) for consistency and also because it will be required for running SIP on activity files. Many online resources can be found with a quick Google search if you get stuck while using `cmd`.    
The first step to using `cmd` is to open a Command Prompt by searching "cmd" in the Start Menu's search bar. The result should be a black box with a flashing cursor. Basic `cmd` commands are:     
```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd C:\file\path     
#changes the current directory of the prompt
dir    
#displays the contents of the current directory
set     
#displays the current environmental variables
M:   
#mounts the drive labeled "M:\". In Windows if you want to access files not on your computer but on another server, you must first mount the drive in the prompt by typing its letter and a ":". Then you may "cd" into directories on that drive.
```     

## Installing SIP   
1. Download and Extract the `SIP-master.zip` file from [SIP-master](https://www.github.com/ischwabacher/SIP/archive/master.zip).        
2. Create a file tree for your activity monitoring processing:   
```{bash eval=FALSE}
###For Windows (Search for "cmd" in the start menu to open a terminal)   
mkdir C:\Activity_Monitor_Processing\Data\subject_0001_example_file\subj_0001_Session_1
```     
Keep your 1secDataTable.csv files in the `\Data` directory. Then separate them by subject ID and within subject ID by each subject's individual sessions.  

3. `SIP-master.zip` will have inside of it another file, `SIP-master`. Copy this file into the `Activity_Monitor_Processing` directory. The `SIP-master.zip` file will likely be in your `Downloads` folder if you clicked the `SIP-master` link above. The `Activity_Monitor_Processing` directory will listed under the`C:\` drive.   

4. Set your PATH to include the `SIP-master` file so your computer knows where to find `SIP.py`:    
```{bash eval=FALSE}
###For Windows (Search for "cmd" in the start menu to open a terminal)   
setx SIP_DIR "C:\Activity_Monitor_Processing\SIP-master"   
setx DATA_DIR "C:\Activity_Monitor_Processing\Data"   
setx PATH PATH;%SIP_DIR%;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;"C:\Program Files\R\R-3.6.1\bin"  
```   
For changes to the PATH to take effect you must restart your current `cmd` `terminal`.    



## Install Python      
`Sojourns` requires the older Python2.7 and older versions of certain packages. Make sure you download and install a version of python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) that begins with "2.7". 
          
1. Install Python        
[Python 2.7.17](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17.amd64.msi)                
If you already use Python2.x for other scripts, then consider looking into an environment manager such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) so you can maintain concurrent environments for different scripts. I will note, I have been unable to get `SIP.py` or `display_sojourns.py` running in [Miniconda for Python 2.7](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).     

2. Install Required Python Packages      
In a `CMD` terminal, run:       
```{bash eval=FALSE}
python -m pip install numpy==1.12.0 matplotlib==2.2.3 nose==1.3.4 pathlib==1.0 tornado==3.1.1 tzlocal==2.0.0 pandas==0.19.2 
```       
3. Set Python as the default program for files with extensions ".py"       
```{bash eval=FALSE}
ftype Python.File="C:\Python27\python.exe" "%1"
assoc .py=Python.File
```          
You need to be logged into an Admin account to run these commands. If you cannot access an Admin account then this can be done through navigating to "C:\Activity_Monitor_Processing\SIP-master" and then right-clicking on `sip.py` (likely will show as only `sip`). For Windows 7, hover over "Open With" and then go to "Choose Default Program...". Here select "Browse" and then navigate to "C:\Python27". In that directory, select `python.exe`. In Windows 10, click on "Open with..." and then check the box for "Always use this app to open .py files". Then select "More apps". Select "Browse" and navigate to "C:\Python27". In that directory, select `python.exe`.           


## Installing R
`Sojourns` uses `R` for its classifcation of activity data. You can install any 3.x.x verison of `R` and it should be compatable with `SIP`.       

1. Download and Install [R 3.6.1](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.6.1-win.exe)       
If you install or already have installed a verison of R that is not 3.6.1 then you will have to adjust the last line of code in the "Installing SIP" section 4 to the correct version number. Change "C:\Program Files\R\R-3.6.1\bin"  to the correct \R-x.x.x\bin.    

2. Open a `CMD` terminal and run `R` by typing:      
```{bash eval=FALSE}
R --vanilla
```       
If this command is not known by the computer, then you must adjust your path to make sure your version of `R` is included on your computer's `PATH`. In the "Installing SIP" section 4, this code is used to set your version of `R` to the path:      
```{bash eval=FALSE}
###For Windows (Search for "cmd" in the start menu to open a terminal)   
setx PATH PATH;"C:\Program Files\R\R-3.6.1\bin"  
```       
Confirm version 3.6.1 is your version of `R` or adjust the code above to your correct version and then run the code in your `CMD` terminal. Then restart your `terminal` before trying to open `R` again in the `terminal`.       

3. Install `R` packages "zoo" and "nnet"      
once `R` is open in your `terminal` run these commands:      
```{bash eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nnet")
install.packages("zoo")
q()
```         


## Test and Run `SIP.py`      
If all steps were successfully completed, if you run `sip.py` in a `CMD` prompt you should get a read out of how to use the `sip.py` function. Try:      
```{bash eval=FALSE}
###For Windows (Search for "cmd" in the start menu to open a terminal)    
sip.py 
```       

1. Run SIP on sample 1secDataTable files:    
```{bash eval=FALSE}
###For Windows (Search for "cmd" in the start menu to open a terminal)    
sip.py %SIP_DIR%\sampledata\ActiGraph
display_sojourns.py %SIP_DIR%\sampledata\ActiGraph
```     

2. To run SIP on your participants data saved in the file tree created above:      
```{bash eval=FALSE}
###For Windows (Search for "cmd" in the start menu to open a terminal)    
sip.py %DATA_DIR%\subject_0001_example_file\subj_0001_Session_1
```     
Simply, save your participants' data following the example file and then sip.py on the file for the participant that corresponds to the "subj_0001_Session_1" file. This file should have a "1secDataTable.csv" file that was created by exporting an `.AGD` file from ActiLife. If the exported Data Table CSV file is named as "1sec.csv" because you have a newer version of ActiLife, then you must rename the file to end with "1secDataTable.csv" so `SIP.py` can locate the file.

3. Run Display_Sojourns.py:     
```{bash eval=FALSE}
###For Windows (Search for "cmd" in the start menu to open a terminal)    
display_sojourns.py %DATA_DIR%\subject_0001_example_file\subj_0001_Session_1
```
